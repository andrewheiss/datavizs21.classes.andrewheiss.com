## Readings

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> [Chapter 9](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/boxplots-violins.html) in Claus Wilke, *Fundamentals of Data Visualization* [@Wilke:2018]
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> Mike Bostock, ["Methods of Comparison, Compared"](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/methods-of-comparison-compared). Explanation of the differences between showing relative differences, absolute differences, and log ratios.
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [Sparkline theory and practice](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR). This is a collection of posts by Edward Tufte about sparklines—scroll down a ways and check out his examples, analysis, and critiques.
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [Time series sparklines](https://flowingdata.com/2017/01/24/one-dataset-visualized-25-ways/02-time-series-sparklines-2/)
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [Comparisons with lollipop charts](https://uc-r.github.io/lollipop). If you're feeling adventurous (and you should!), do this tutorial as you read it.

### Reproducible examples

Reprexes (or reproducible examples) are the best way to (1) get help online and (2) fix issues on your own. 

Making a good reprex is tricky, but it's a very valuable skill to know (regardless of programming language!). Here are some helpful resources for making them:

- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [What's a reproducible example (`reprex`) and how do I do one?](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-whats-a-reproducible-example-reprex-and-how-do-i-do-one/5219)
- <i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> [So you've been asked to make a reprex](https://www.jessemaegan.com/post/so-you-ve-been-asked-to-make-a-reprex/)
- <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> [The reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/index.html)

### Questions to reflect on

*(Remember, you don't need to answer all of these—or even any of them! These are just here to help guide your thinking.)*

- These readings all show a ton of new ways to present comparisons. Which ones are your favorite? Which ones didn't quite click with you? In what situations are some more appropriate than others?


## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

`r blogdown::shortcode("slide-buttons")`

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_tabs(slide_details, "/slides/08-slides.html")
```

:::fyi
**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.
